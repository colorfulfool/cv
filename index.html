        My name is <name>Anton</name>. I don't like labels, but here are some to give you an idea of what I do: <buzzword>self&#8209employed</buzzword> <buzzword>software consultant/developer</buzzword>. I don't have a regular CV since I never worked <i>for</i> someone. So I'll just describe what I do being self-employed.
      </p>
      <p id="process">
        I never ask clients for technical specs. Instead I ask what they do and, more importantly, <i>how</i> they do it. I try to understand the challenges and goals of their business. Then I try to devise the shortest and simplest way those goals can be achieved with the help of modern tech.

        Features articles (written by the team), soccer statistics (gathered by the team) and countless links between them. Statistic part was eventually scrapped, but the magazine part still lives and prospers 3 years later.

        I started out as a <buzzword>C++</buzzword> developer, but shortly switched to <buzzword>Python</buzzword>. Over the course of two years,  gradually shifted from desktop apps to web apps. Last year, moved from <buzzword>Django</buzzword> to <buzzword>Rails</buzzword> and not looking back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak <buzzword>English</buzzword>. My native language is <buzzword>Russian</buzzword>. There's also <buzzword>Belarusian</buzzword>, but that's probably not very relevant.
