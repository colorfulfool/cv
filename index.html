        My name is <name>Anton</name>. I don't like labels, but here are some to give you an idea of what I do: <buzzword>self&#8209employed</buzzword> <buzzword>software engineer</buzzword>. Now let me describe how.
      </p>
      <p id="process">
        I never ask clients for technical specs. Instead I ask what they do and, more importantly, how they do it. Then I try to devise the shortest and simplest way those goals can be achieved with the help of tech.

      <p class="projects">Here are some of my projects:</p>
      
      <div id="lettersandsigns">
        <p class="name">
          <a href="https://letters-and-signs.herokuapp.com/products/cast-metal-letters" target="blank">lettersandsigns.com</a><br>
          Official website of a California-based company that makes signs, plaques and letters.
        </p>

          I invite you to try the app for yourself if you have the time. May not seem impressive at first, but note that the price is calculated based on pricelists I get from the company. I get them as XLS spreadsheets and convert to JSON with Rake tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each product has its own rules and constraints. If you still have time, click around the top menu and watch how price depends on parameters differently for each kind of letters. Each also has different constraints: what sizes a font comes in, what finishes can be applied to letters of a particular thickness and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have some more time to spare, look at websites of the competitors. Look how slow and clumsy they are! <a href="http://www.woodlandmanufacturing.com/painted-aluminum-letters.html" target="blank" class="competitor">woodlandmanufacturing.com</a> <a href="https://www.alphabetsigns.com/signs/plastic-building-sign-letter-designer.html" target="blank" class="competitor">alphabetsigns.com</a>

        <p>
          This is not all. Planned are administrative website for empoyees to manage orders and QuickBooks integration for automatic invoicing.

          A tool for self-employed professionals — like myself — that covers task managment, billing and collecting. I made it for myself and was planning to sell to others, but ulitmately didn't. It wasn't as useful as I expected, to be honest. But in the process I learned about React, server-side rendering and various approaches to styling in modern Javascript.

          The interface works like a to-do app, but: you can assign monetary value to items, invoice for the checked-off items with a single click and it remembers what items you've already invoiced for. Look:

        I started out six years ago making desktop applications in <buzzword>C++</buzzword>, then web-applications in <buzzword>Python</buzzword> with <buzzword>Django</buzzword>. Four years ago I moved to full-stack web applications with <buzzword>Ruby on Rails</buzzword> and <buzzword>Javascript</buzzword>.

      <p>
        I speak <buzzword>English</buzzword>. My native language is <buzzword>Russian</buzzword>. There's also <buzzword>Belarusian</buzzword>, but that's probably not very relevant.
