        My name is Anton. I don't like labels, but here are some to give you an idea of what I do: <buzzword>self-employed</buzzword> <buzzword>software consultant/developer</buzzword>. I don't have a regular CV since I never worked <i>for</i> someone. So I'll just describe what I do being self-employed.

        I never ask clients for technical specs. Instead I ask what they do and, more importantly, <i>how</i> they do it. I try to understand the challenges and goals of their business. Then I try to devise the shortest and simplest way those goals can be achieved with the help of modern tech.
