        My name is <name>Anton</name>. I don't like labels, but here are some to give you an idea of what I do: <buzzword>self&#8209employed</buzzword> <buzzword>software maker</buzzword>. Now let me describe how I do it.
      </p>
      <p id="process">
        I never ask clients for technical specs. Instead I ask what they do and, more importantly, <i>how</i> they do it. I try to understand the challenges and goals of their business. Then I try to devise the shortest and simplest way those goals can be achieved with the help of modern tech.

        <a href="https://letters-and-signs.herokuapp.com/products/cast-metal-letters" target="blank">lettersandsigns.com</a><br>
        Official website of a California-based company that makes signs, plaques and letters.

        I invite you to try the app for yourself (if you have time). May not seem impressive at first, but note that the price is calculated based on pricelists I get from the company. I get them as XLS spreadsheets and convert to JSON with Rake tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each product has its own rules and constraints. If you still have time, click around the top menu and watch how price depends on parameters differently for each kind of letters. Each also has different constraints: what sizes a font comes in, what finishes can be applied to letters of a particular thickness and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have some more time to spare, look at websites of the competitors. Look how slow and clumsy they are! <a href="http://www.woodlandmanufacturing.com/painted-aluminum-letters.html" target="blank" class="competitor">woodlandmanufacturing.com</a> <a href="https://www.alphabetsigns.com/signs/plastic-building-sign-letter-designer.html" target="blank" class="competitor">alphabetsigns.com</a>

        I started out six years ago making desktop applications in <buzzword>C++</buzzword>, then web-applications in <buzzword>Python</buzzword> with <buzzword>Django</buzzword>. Four years ago I moved to full-stack web applications with <buzzword>Ruby or Rails</buzzword> and <buzzword>Javascript</buzzword> and not looking back.
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak <buzzword>English</buzzword>. My native language is <buzzword>Russian</buzzword>. There's also <buzzword>Belarusian</buzzword>, but that's probably not very relevant.
